# Food Ordering Application

## Proposal
 
The application is used for food ordering in restaurants. It can hold and manage all items the restaurants provide, and it allows customers to
order items on this application. Stuffs can add and remove items to this application, thay can also manage the list of orders from customers.
Customers can order these provided items on this application. 

Having effective and efficient communication to stuffs in restaurants is almost impossible for me, espacially in the noisy environment or under
the circumstance that I do not know how to pronounce the food name correctly. I have to repeat myself multiple times to have effective
communication with stuffs. Therefore, I choose this project to improve the efficiency of communication of food ordering in restaurants.
